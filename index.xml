If they do a thorough job for $59 or whatever price they’re promoting, be sure to leave them a generous gratuity. If they advertise that something would cost $59 but then charge you $800 for a few of hours labour, don’t tip them (they should have a nice commission).
As a result, one would wonder whether duct cleaning is a waste of money in this case. A thorough duct cleaning performed every 5-7 years by a business that does not consider duct cleaning to be a waste of money may bring relief from a wide range of issues.</description></item><item><title>Downton Abbey fans furious after spotting major photoshop change to Maggie Smith</title><link>/downton-abbey-fans-furious-after-spotting-major-photoshop-change-to-maggie-smith.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/downton-abbey-fans-furious-after-spotting-major-photoshop-change-to-maggie-smith.html</guid><description>What do you think?
