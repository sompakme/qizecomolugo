Season 4 of Virgin River dropped one year after the third—<strong>on July 20, 2022</strong>—with the show's fifth season shooting this summer.</p><p>It&nbsp;isn't exactly a surprise that Netflix has high hopes for the long-term future of Virgin River. There are&nbsp;25&nbsp;books—yes, you read that right—in the&nbsp;Virgin River&nbsp;book series by Robyn Carr&nbsp;that the show is based on. Not to mention, season three jumped to the top of the Netflix charts almost immediately and,&nbsp;per Nielson,&nbsp;pulled in more than 1.4 million viewers in its first week; by the end of its first month on Netflix, it was the top-streamed content&nbsp;in the entire country. Likely due to this demand, Netflix quickly green-lit more episodes for the fourth season, and season 4 will clock in at 12 episodes rather than the usual 10.</p><p>So, before you dive into season four, what do we know about it?

And we're finally going to find out who shot Jack—right? Let's dig in.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-virgin-river-season-4><span>'Virgin River' Season 4</span></h2><p>In mid-May, Netflix confirmed the release date for Virgin River season 4: <strong>July 20, 2022. </strong>The description for the new season, courtesy of Netflix: "Despite not knowing whether her baby belongs to her deceased husband, Mark, or Jack, [Mel] has a sense of optimism. For years she yearned to be a mother, and her dream is one step closer to reality. While Jack is supportive and excited, the question of paternity continues to gnaw at him," it reads. (A love triangle? Hasn't Jack been through enough?!)&nbsp;</p><p>"Complicating matters is the arrival of a handsome new doctor, who’s in the market to start a family of his own," the description continues. "Hope is still healing from her car accident, and the lingering psychological effects of her brain injury will have profound consequences for both her and Doc. Brie, intent on proving the innocence of the man she loves, unexpectedly finds herself in a closer relationship with Mike and one step closer to Calvin’s violent criminal web.

We're likely to see Paige again after her absence for the whole of the third season, and hopefully she'll be reunited with Christopher.

"We do move ahead. To us, it's [about] the recovery and what she's dealing with—a traumatic brain injury." In a later interview with EW, O'Toole noted, "A traumatic brain injury is such a huge thing that happens not just to the person, but to the people around them, and in her case, the community, since she's the mayor...I loved coming back and having a lot to do and something that was that organic and that I could play within the bounds of because a brain injury is unique to each person."</p><p>Also of note: Hope and Muriel may also become friends in season four, if you can believe it. Tenney told&nbsp;EW:&nbsp;"The more fun relationship is the one between Muriel and Hope. It starts as very antagonistic...In the slow burn category, you'll see moments coming up that are going to open up that relationship."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/97iUTDErvQjYsi8kMzXqEB-1920-80.jpg><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-the-cast-says><span>What the Cast Says</span></h2><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-jack><span>Jack</span></h3><p>Like I said, we'll find out who shot Jack in season four...right? Um...probably.

Alexandra Breckenridge, who plays Mel,&nbsp;laughed to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tvinsider.com/1005083/virgin-river-season-3-mel-pregnant-jack-mark-alexandra-breckenridge/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>TV Insider</a>: "Well, I know who shot Jack!"</p><p>Season four is likely to be a rocky journey for Jack...well, another one. (Poor Jack has been through a&nbsp;lot.)&nbsp;Even on top of the fatherhood situation—his prospective custody battle over the twins, not to mention Mel's ex-husband potentially being the father of her baby—Henderson hinted to&nbsp;TV Line&nbsp;that&nbsp;Jack's ex-wife of three months, Mandy, might just make a return.&nbsp;"Mandy showing up in&nbsp;Virgin River&nbsp;would complicate things even more. It's possible with this show," he said.</p><p>Speaking to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://ew.com/tv/virgin-river-season-4-around-the-table/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>EW</a>, Henderson said: "The show of course is about romance, but a lot of what appeals to people is the idea that all these people are broken. Everyone's got a past, everyone's got trauma, everyone's got something they're trying to deal with...We're not just seeing heroes and people saving the day. They're also carrying these deep wounds and they need each other and their relationships are the lens through which we get to see them grapple with their demons and their hurts, and the things that make them human and make them vulnerable."</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-mel><span>Mel</span></h3><p>Mel ended season three by telling Jack—mid-proposal, no less—that she was pregnant, but that he may or may not be the father of her baby. "I was on pins and needles to find out how Jack and Mel were going to deal with the pregnancy," she told EW, and added in an interview with Glamour: "That ball is in Jack's court, but viewers will get answers. They just might not come right away. You might need to finish the season to find out."</p><p>She explained to Glamour: "In a very short time she's gone from being quite literally emotionally broken to having all of her pieces put back together. And she's able to have something she never thought would be possible: She's pregnant and in love. She's in a really good place for the most part. But there's this gnawing feeling of, what if I lose the baby?"&nbsp;</p><p>Mel, of course, tragically lost her first child soon before losing her first husband Mark prior to moving to Virgin River. Elaborating during an interview with The List, Breckenridge noted: "We get to know her real feelings about it through the stillbirth that she delivers at the clinic, and there's one scene where she talks to Jack about how she really feels. It's this underlying emotional weight that Mel has that we don't really touch on a lot."</p><p>She also hinted in an interview with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://parade.com/tv/virgin-river-season-4-alexandra-breckenridge-interview referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Parade</a> that Mel still has some hidden trauma: "We found Mel in a very broken place. She was trying to outrun her past and I’m not sure how much of that she really dealt with, to be honest with you."</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-charmaine><span>Charmaine</span></h3><p>Tenney noted in an interview with&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly&nbsp;that Charmaine will have even more to deal with in season four, on top of the twins, her new marriage, and the upcoming custody fight. "We have a pretty big bombshell for [Charmaine] coming in the following season...that's going to blow everybody away." But Charmaine was absent from the first-look photos shared by Netflix, suggesting that she may have a smaller role than in previous seasons.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-doc><span>Doc</span></h3><a href=# data-model-name="Virgin River: Book 2" data-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009YF3KP4 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB009YF3KP4%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mkL4izM6TbPhw47kuq45jE-1920-80.png></p></a><p>'Virgin River: Book 2'</p><a href=# data-model-name="'Virgin River: Book 3'" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Whispering-Rock-Virgin-River-Novel/dp/0778331520/ref=asc_df_0778331520/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459527104463&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13591910194983678430&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9004351&hvtargid=pla-920220691576&psc=1" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FWhispering-Rock-Virgin-River-Novel%2Fdp%2F0778331520%2Fref%3Dasc_df_0778331520%2F%3FlinkCode%3Ddf0%26hvadid%3D459527104463%26hvpos%3D%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvrand%3D13591910194983678430%26hvpone%3D%26hvptwo%3D%26hvqmt%3D%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvdvcmdl%3D%26hvlocint%3D%26hvlocphy%3D9004351%26hvtargid%3Dpla-920220691576%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LqQA9L5zAvW38f5tKP9cH9-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>'Virgin River: Book 3'</p><p>As for Doc's grandson, who showed up in Virgin River at the end of season three: "It's going to complicate, and it's going to bring insight into Doc and into Doc's beginnings," noted Tenney to&nbsp;EW.</p><p>At first, Doc will think he's being scammed, Tim Matheson (who plays Doc)&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://ew.com/tv/virgin-river-tim-matheson-interview-doc-family-secret-future/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>told&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly.</a>&nbsp;"It's just such drama, such conflict, such interesting stuff to get into.

It's almost like a new beginning for someone when you find out you have offspring. It's a rebirth for him."</p><p>Doc already has plenty on his plate, given Hope's car accident.

In season four, we may see more of Mark, in spite of his being, well, dead. Basically, we may get much more backstory about their marriage, potentially in light of Mark having a 50/50 chance of being the father of Mel's baby. "Here’s what I’ll say, somewhat enigmatically: the good news about being the dead husband is that you can appear at any time.

Well, Tenney hinted that Ricky was serious about enlisting. "It seems impulsive, but it’s not. It’s something he’s wanted since he was 13," she told&nbsp;TV Line, citing the Ricky of the book series as proof. "Ricky and Lizzie are growing and maturing at different rates, but we hope they’ll get to the same place at a certain point."</p><p>But they may&nbsp;not—at least according to actor Grayson Gurnsey, who plays Ricky. In an interview with&nbsp;TV Line, he said: "When it's your first love, you might not necessarily love that person for the right reasons, but you can still learn something very valuable and become a better person from that relationship." Sob.</p><p>First-look photos suggest that whatever happens between the two, they certainly get screen time in season 4, so we can assume Brady hasn't left yet:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mkL4izM6TbPhw47kuq45jE-1920-80.png><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-brady><span>Brady</span></h3><p>We left season three with Brady under arrest for the attempted murder of Jack—but Hollingsworth shared with&nbsp;TV Insider: <strong>"I think Brady witnessed something that I don’t even know if Jack knows."</strong> He added: "We saw a softer side of him, someone who’s compassionate, understanding, empathetic, someone who is worthy of love, capable of love, all of those things don’t lend themselves to a cold-blooded killer, especially of one of his close friends."
