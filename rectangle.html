The perimeter for a rectangle (P) is given as: 2l + 2w = P We're given P = 258 and l = 71. Plug these values in: 2(71) + 2w = 258 142 + 2w = 258 [URL='https://www.mathcelebrity.com/1unk.php?num=142%2B2w%3D258&pl=Solve']Typing this equation into our search engine[/URL], we get: [B]w = 58[/B]<br></p><a href=# title="Click to jump to The perimeter of a rectangular shelf is 60 inches.

The perimeter for a rectangle is given below: P = 2l + 2w We're given l = 7 and P = 60. Plug this into the perimeter formula: 60 = 2(7) + 2w 60 = 14 + 2w Rewritten, it's 2w + 14 = 60.
