Coming from the established worlds of magazines and technology, it was a little daunting to be newcomers in a burgeoning space. We wanted to create a platform that would help people see weed the way we did: as something that makes our lives nice. Working with experts, doctors, and activists, we created a beautifully-designed site that covers the science behind weed, profiles successful people we love that openly use cannabis, and breaks down hemp and cannabis laws that need to be reformed.</p><p>We really couldn’t anticipate the reception we’d get from people already established in the industry. But shortly after we launched, other brands started to notice us and female founders reached out. Before we knew it, introductions to potential clients were made and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.y7-studio.com/shop-apparel/?category=CBD" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>collaborations were hatched</a>.

Why would I think any differently?</p><p>But the reality is that every year, female representation in cannabis and hemp declines to reflect the “traditional economy” (a.k.a. white males). The latest report from 2018 calculated that<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-and-Minorities-Report.pdf referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>&nbsp;only 27 percent of cannabis companies</a>&nbsp;have women in executive positions.

As the brains behind Ananda Hemp’s formulations, Capano creates the tinctures, balms, and capsules you see in stores. She oversees hemp research—including studies on opioid reduction, which Capano believes will showcase how cannabis, particularly CBD will “safely and effectively combat a major health crisis”—and fields patients’ clinical questions. She’s also become a leading voice in the scientific community, and travels the globe to educate patients and politicians on the science of hemp.</p><p>Leading by example, Capano finds that the best way to uplift women is “to demonstrate that we can and should be leaders” in the industry, she says. “It’s not always easy to be the squeaky wheel, but it’s incredibly important to practice what you preach.”</p><h2 id=kimberly-dillon-3>Kimberly Dillon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZSNPPuzDEbYCmNNhdbUQS-1920-80.png><p>Though it might seem like CBD became normalized overnight, it really didn't.
