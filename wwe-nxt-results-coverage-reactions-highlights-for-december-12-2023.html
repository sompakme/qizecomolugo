Trick responds to a few inquiries as Hayes makes his way inside the venue. When asked about New Year’s Evil, Hayes assures that he will handle his responsibilities.</p><p>We take a look at the standout moments from Deadline.</p><p>Carmelo Hayes is spotted in the back, clutching his leg as referees tend to him. Trick arrives on the scene, seeking information about the incident.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Cora Jade stands in the ring, reflecting on her four-month absence. She mentions the fans missing her and insists that everything is now back to normal. She questions the fans’ shift in opinion from not liking her before to now loving her. She emphasizes that her return made Deadline memorable, overshadowing the Women’s Iron Survivor Match.</p><p>Lyra Valkyria interrupts and welcomes Cora back, but she points out that Cora didn’t mention attacking her from behind. Lyra suggests that Cora might still resort to shortcuts. Cora playfully asks if she has caused some controversy.</p><p>Lyra responds by stating that while Cora may remain unchanged, things have evolved in her absence. She asserts her status as the women’s champion and claims not to care about what Cora deserves. Blair Davenport interjects, reminding Lyra that she defeated four others to become the Iron Survivor, a feat Cora did not achieve. Blair confidently predicts her victory at New Year’s Evil.</p><p>Lyra challenges Blair’s claim, confident that she will retain her title. She remarks on their shared tendency to attack opponents from behind. Nikkita Lyons enters the scene, expressing her resentment towards Blair for past actions.</p><p>A brawl ensues in the ring, with Nikkita and Lyra eventually sending Blair and Cora tumbling to the floor. The segment concludes with a recap of the altercation between Fallon and Friends and MetaFour at Deadline.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><br>We’re back with Kelly and Dragon Lee.</p><p>Kelly extends her congratulations to Dragon Lee for his recent victory and inquires about his feelings. Dragon Lee expresses his joy, stating that Saturday marked a dream come true for him. He’s thrilled to have Rey Mysterio by his side and to have clinched his first NXT Title. He acknowledges that he wouldn’t have had the opportunity if Wes had not been injured and wishes Wes a swift recovery. Dragon Lee vows to defend the title just as vigorously as Wes did.</p><p>Kelly then asks about his upcoming opponent, to which Lee replies that the answer will be revealed in the ring.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lash-legend-oro-mensah-and-noam-dar-with-jakara-jackson-vs-fallon-henley-josh-briggs-and-brooks-jensen>Lash Legend, Oro Mensah, and Noam Dar (with Jakara Jackson) vs. Fallon Henley, Josh Briggs, and Brooks Jensen</h2><p>Dar launches an attack on Brooks while perched on the turnbuckle, and their scuffle spills to the arena floor. The match officially begins as Lash enters the fray, landing an elbow drop for a close two-count. Lash sends Fallon into the turnbuckles, but she counters with a well-placed boot. Fallon retaliates with a punch, prompting Lash to push her away. Fallon applies a sleeper hold, but Lash backs her into the turnbuckles. Lash executes a snapmare, and Fallon responds with a barrage of forearms. Lash blocks an Irish whip and delivers a forearm shot. Fallon attempts a sunset flip, but Lash skillfully maintains her footing and pulls Fallon back up. Fallon strikes with a leg drop to the back and a side kick. She then tries for a bulldog, but Lash pushes her off.</p><p>Brooks tags in, but Lash appears reluctant to exit the ring. Oro misses a forearm strike, and Brooks counters with punches and forearms. Brooks whips Oro into the turnbuckles and follows up with a chop and forearm.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tiffany Stratton is seen watching the match on a backstage monitor.</p><p>Brooks executes a faceplant, and Josh interferes by hitting Dar in the back. Brooks and Josh roll to the outside, trading punches. Lash hoists Fallon overhead and press slams her onto Josh and Brooks outside the ring.

Fallon attempts a slam, but Lash escapes, and Brooks tags back in.</p><p>Brooks delivers back elbows to Oro, who responds with an Irish whip. Brooks counters with a crossbody off the turnbuckles. Oro retaliates with a leg sweep and a Northern Lariat, followed by choking Brooks in the ropes. Brooks falls to the floor, clutching his ankle. Dar tags in and targets Brooks’ shoulder while Oro kicks the ropes to inflict more damage to the leg.</p><p>Brooks manages to land a punch, but Oro counters with a knee. Brooks sends Oro over the top rope to the floor, attempting a leg sweep in the process. However, Brooks’ knee gives out, allowing Oro to kick the injured leg.
